<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>"We can never talk of the theatre without harking back to the play
itself," says "The Matinée Girl" in <i>The Evening News</i>. Funny how these
irrelevant trifles will obtrude themselves into the most facile critic's
train of thought.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>So simple and successful has been the progress of the Daylight-Saving
Scheme, under which the clock is to be put forward an hour during the
summer months, that a movement is on foot to help the War Office
prophets by putting the War back a couple of years.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>It is not generally known that during the week ending May 7th a fourth
Zeppelin was sunk by H.M.S. Feuilleton.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>A tremendous boom in canaries is reported from New York. The colour is
believed to be a favourite one with the hyphenated.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>Breconshire County Council is proposing to abolish Sunday fishing. It is
felt, however, that the demands of the Sabbath will be met if the
fishermen can be prevented from describing their exploits till Monday
morning.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>An evening contemporary has the following heading:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">&quot;Hindenburg Seedy.</span></p>

<p class="center">Petrograd tale of a gloomy 'Papa' and an angry Below.&quot;</p>

<p>Can the Prussian idol have contracted so vulgar an ailment as a pain in
his underneath?</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>Sabadilla, it appears, is a plant of the Lily family, from which is
extracted a poison that forms the basis of the German "tear" shells. An
allied form, "Crocodilla," also possessing lachrymatory properties, is
likewise extensively used by the German Government.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>It is observed that the Committee to investigate the administration and
command of the Royal Flying Corps is composed of four lawyers and two
engineers. The large proportion of "doers" to "talkers"&mdash;nearly half the
total&mdash;is a startling innovation in British public affairs and a
satisfactory sign that the Government is thoroughly awake to the gravity
of the situation.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>"Pawn-tickets are evidences of real poverty&mdash;when a man pawns his shirts
and so on," said Judge <span class="smcap">Cluer</span> recently at Whitechapel. "And so off" would
have been a more logical way of putting it.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>A Camberwell recruit has taken a white mouse in his pocket as a mascot.
It is to be hoped that he will not get into a tight corner and be
compelled to hoist the white mouse in token of surrender.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>A sackful of comatose flies has been taken from the Coronation clock
tower at Surbiton. The authorities are said to be contemplating the
removal of a similar deposit from underneath Big Ben.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>A German scientist has expressed the opinion that the product obtained
by mixing chaff or finely-chopped straw with pig's blood scarcely
deserves to be called bread. It is, however, expected that the German
trader, ever resourceful, will get over this little difficulty by
calling it cake and charging a little more for it.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>A Dublin office boy, returning to his employment after a fortnight's
absence, informed his employer that he had been fighting and a prisoner;
whereas, of course, in similar circumstances an English lad would have
contented himself with explaining that he had merely been taking the
letters to the post.</p>

<p class="center">*<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">*</span><br />
*</p>

<p>The sports programme to be contested at Blackheath on May 20th will
include various events open to attested men. We wish the management
could have seen their way to include a Consolation Sack Race (with water
hazards) for Conscientious Objectors.</p>

<h2>UNWRITTEN LETTERS TO THE KAISER.</h2>

<p class="center">No. XXXIX.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>From <span class="smcap">James J. Saltontale</span>, of New York City.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kaiser William</span>,&mdash;I guess you'll remember who I am when I tell you
that the Jay-Jay Lecture Agency and the Pushalong Dramatic Show Company
were invented by me and that I'm the sole possessor of these two
world-wide organisations. I wasn't always in with the high-brow crowd of
the lecturing business. To tell you the truth I began quite low down
with a six-legged pig that could spell out the word "pork" by touching
the letters with his snout on a big cardboard alphabet. He didn't last
long. Times were hard during his second winter, and&mdash;well, I never
knew till then how much bacon there is to a pig, even when it's a
learned one with six legs to it. It was always some trouble tying on
them two extra legs, and it was nervous work watching them while the
show was open to see they didn't work loose. So on the whole I wasn't
altogether put into mourning when old six-legs joined the dear departed
and left me free to speculate in Mexican dwarfs and a Bolivian giantess
with a rich contralto voice.</p>

<p>After that we rose to lions and tigers and a very massive elephant and a
few comic bears and a gorilla from Africa. It was profitable but tiring,
and after I'd saved a dollar or two I was able to retire from the
Mammoth Antediluvian Menagerie and devote myself to Lectures and the
Pushalong stunt, which is living pictures of an historic and improving
sort. So now you remember me, don't you?</p>

<p>Well, the fact is, Kaiser, that a notion's come into my head, and it's
this. When peace comes with all its horrors, you won't want to go on
every day explaining to the German people how you lost the War by being
too kind or by not having prepared yourself enough. And you won't want
to keep telling them why you spent so much time over Verdun and why the
British Fleet didn't make things as easy and comfortable for you as you
reckoned it ought to have done. The German people won't want to listen
to talk of that kind. They've been there and they'll know all about it
without being told. No, what you'll want to do will be to get into a new
atmosphere, with people all round you listening to you just as if you
were the only man in the world. You'll find all that in the United
States if you'll only put yourself in the hands of the Jay-Jay Lecturing
Agency and the Pushalong Dramatic Show Company. We shall engage the
halls and get together the audiences by our unique system of
advertisements, and all you've got to do is to appear at the time fixed
and address the meeting for an hour to an hour and a-half on such
subjects as "Why Belgium started the War," and "How Serbia used Poison
Gas," and "A Dozen Proofs that the <i>Lusitania</i> was Sunk by the British
out of Spite," and "Turkey, the Saviour of the Armenians." There'll be
plenty of others, but these four will do as a good working basis, and we
can fill out the list later on, not forgetting the Monroe Doctrine and
how Germany is going to knock everyone who attacks it into pie.</p>

<p>Then, there can be living pictures of yourself, in all kinds of
uniforms, deciding reluctantly to issue an ultimatum, or packing your
valise for the Front, or leading two millions of men in a charge and
bringing back four millions of prisoners or setting an example to your
people by eating War-bread by the crumb. And then you can wind up the
evening's entertainment by showing yourself making a speech in which you
bring in that bit about the good old German God who has always been your
ally. And then the audience will stream out very devoutly, and all of
them will shake you by the hand and say they're pleased to meet you. I
tell you, <span class="smcap">William Hohenzollern</span>, it will be great, and the dollars will
come pouring in. Leave it all to me, and I'll guarantee a success
that'll make you grateful to me for ever. If we could only get Uncle
<span class="smcap">Francis Joseph</span> to join&mdash;but no; that might distract attention from
you, and it's you I'm banking on. All I ask is a miserable twenty per
cent. on the profits. Is it a bargain?</p>

<p class="center">Yours,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">James J. S.</span></p>

<h2>THE VESTY DEEP.</h2>

<p>Which is the most valuable&mdash;life, comfort or self-respect? A little while
ago I should have said, without a moment's hesitation, life. But now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning, let me say that before the <i>Sussex</i> was
torpedoed by the Quixotic Hun I had decided to go to France. Then came
that tragedy, and as a result letters from friends and the relatives
whose affection I still retain, urging first that the French enterprise
should be abandoned altogether, and, second, that, if not, a
life-preserving device should be instantly obtained. Advertisements cut
from newspapers accompanied some of these letters containing
testimonials in favour of this belt and that.</p>

<p>Having no particular reason for losing my life, at any rate without a
struggle&mdash;provided always that the operation was not too expensive&mdash;I
gave more attention to these advertisements than to any others since at
school, too long ago, the entrancing and persuasive firm of <span class="smcap">Theobald</span>
spread his lures before us; and having done so I obediently obeyed their
instructions and wrote for illustrated pamphlets. [Does anyone, I wonder
by the way, collect illustrated pamphlets? The illustrated pamphlets of
this War alone should make a valuable exhibit some day.] Having studied
them, I found very quickly that, though the belts were of various kinds,
all were alike in two or three points, one being the description of
themselves as vests or waistcoats rather than belts; and another the
claims of each to be the best. Some relied for their buoyancy on the
element upon which Mr. <span class="smcap">Pemberton-Billing</span> has floated to notoriety, if
not fame, and had to be blown up; others trusted to some mysterious
fibre several times more buoyant than cork; a third&mdash;but these two will
serve as types of all.</p>

<p>Each, as I say, was the best; and, however different in material, all
were alike too in one effect, for each in saving one's life saved it the
right way up. There are, it seems, buoyant belts, or vest, so lost to
shame as to submerge the wearer's head and shoulders and leave only his
legs exposed. But not so with these; these had no such tricks; these
undertook to maintain me topside up with care. The pictures in the
pamphlets were invariably of gentlemen of vaster proportions even than
myself, all riding buoyantly and securely on the waves, like Dr. <span class="smcap">Burney</span>
in <span class="smcap">Barry's</span> fresco at the Society of Arts&mdash;and all dressed more or less
becomingly in the best vest.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/359.png">
<img src="images/i_359.png" width="428" height="600" alt="MANAGER" title="" /></a>
<span class="caption"><br /><i>Manager.</i> &quot;<span class="smcap">There&#39;s a rumour that three Zepps are coming
over</span>.&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Leading Actor (playing to poor house).</i> &quot;<span class="smcap">Well, you&#39;ve got plenty of
room for &#39;em in front!&quot;</span></span>
</div>

<p>Each being of superlative excellence, I had to apply other principles of
selection, and fell back upon the most usual of those, which is
financial. I had to answer the question. At what sum do I value my
life?&mdash;the range of price being from seven-and-six to two pounds ten.
Was my life worth two pounds ten? I inquired of myself. It's a lot of
money, I replied. Should it not rather go into Exchequer Bonds? What
would Mr. <span class="smcap">McKenna</span> say? You see how complex the situation suddenly
became.</p>

<p>After long deliberation and taking into consideration the circumstance
that the vest which was priced at fifty shillings had to be inflated
before it was of any use and that the arrival of a torpedo would
probably deprive me of all breath, or at any rate, of all blowing power,
I decided that two pounds ten was excessive. No life could be worth
that. I was therefore, after further communings, driven back on the
astonishing fibre at fifteen shillings; and one of these vests I ordered
to be sent to the boat. So far, so good.</p>

<p>Now I do not say that the advertisement and the illustrated pamphlet had
exactly called the vest a stylish addition to ordinary attire, but there
was reticence as to any unsightly effect upon the figure. So little
emphasis was laid on this that one quite naturally expected something
rather like a vest. Not of course such an article as that historic
waistcoat which <span class="smcap">Dickens</span> borrowed from <span class="smcap">Macready</span>, but a vest not devoid of
vestiness&mdash;something that a gentleman could negligently pace the deck
in, without being too ostentatiously engaged in the task or pastime of
saving his life; or sleep in with comfort, all ready for the water when
the Hun arrived.</p>

<p>Imagine then my surprise on finding in my cabin a parcel that might by
its size have contained an assortment of pumpkins, from which I
extracted an article no doubt many times more buoyant than cork, but
adapted far less to walking a deck in or wooing reluctant slumbers in
than for (obviously its real purpose) assisting Sir <span class="smcap">Herbert Tree</span> to make
up as <i>Falstaff.</i></p>

<p>Carefully locking the door, I put it on and tied its tapes and fastened
its buckles. The result was more than comic&mdash;it was grotesque; and with
an overcoat to cover it I looked like one of the two <span class="smcap">Macs</span> of blessed
memory. Could life be saved thus? Only by sitting up in my cabin all
night, for as to going on deck in it&mdash;not for a ransom! And as for
sleeping in it&mdash;that was beyond all question. I therefore took it off,
and sadly I climbed the companion to see how the rest of the passengers
looked in their various vests; but either they had found a trimmer build
than mine, which I doubt, or they too had shirked the ordeal. The result
was that all our lives&mdash;even my fifteen-shilling one&mdash;were at the
disposal of the Hun. So is it to be English.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the saving of my own life is not, I am convinced, my forte. My
forte is fatalism and trust in a star that hitherto has not been too
capricious. Perhaps that is England's forte too.</p>

<h2>A TERRITORIAL IN INDIA.</h2>

<p class="center">XIII.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;Since landing in India about 200 years ago we have
had many novel and remarkable experiences, but I think in my case none
has been more strange and disconcerting than my transformation into a
civilian or a <i>dufter wallah</i> (as we who sit at desks are contemptuously
termed by the fighting men).</p>

<p>Table manners are a great trial to me in my new employ. In barracks, if
you want bread, you merely shout in the queer jargon of the British
soldier in India, "<i>Hao</i> up the <i>roti</i> there!" You then duck quickly,
brush the crumbs out of your hair and get on with the meal. As a
civilian I have to count ten, take myself firmly in hand, prepare a
courteous little speech and deliver it with care and precision, trying
hard to avoid glancing over my shoulder to see if a lump is likely to
catch me under the ear.</p>

<p>And every night, though it is now over two months since I left the
regiment, I carefully feel the legs of my bedstead before retiring to
rest. For in barrack life, when you lie down unsuspectingly on a bed
which has been "set," it instantly collapses into a shapeless mass of
wreckage and shoots you out violently on the floor.</p>

<p>In the office itself my new life is full of difficulties. Soon after my
arrival I thoughtlessly celebrated the completion of a rather
troublesome task by bursting into song, as we always did in barracks.
Shortly afterwards I received a frigidly polite message from my superior
officer, saying, if I had any complaint to make, would I be so good as
to put it into writing and to refrain from any vocal advertisement of my
grievances.</p>

<p>But even office life has its compensations. There are moments of pure
delight, such as that in which I discovered "<i>Cemeteries</i>" classified
under the general heading of "<i>Accommodation for Troops</i>."</p>

<p>And the Babu is always with us to make our days joyful. Babu English is
perhaps rather <i>vieux jeu</i> at this time of day; nevertheless it is a
privilege to read on the spot a supplication for permission to
"prostitute myself daily to your holy feet this time without fail
whereby to beseech to Heaven to send to your Honour many posthumous
olive branches"; or a request that "your Highness will not cause to <i>nip
in the Bud</i> my unworthy yet fragrant hopes by the December <i>cold snap</i>
of your august displeasure."</p>

<p>In conversation, excellent fellow as he usually is, the Babu is easily
misunderstood. It was only yesterday that one of them was giving me an
account of an old Sikh monk he had come upon during a walk in the woods.
I had not known before that there were monks among the Sikhs, but then
there are quite a number of facts about India that I have yet to learn.</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in picturing the aged hermit sitting at the foot of
a tree in a religious trance. But it seemed strange that when the Babu
approached he should have shown his teeth and gibbered. This, however,
might be due to the eccentricity of a recluse or to some caste
difficulty. I could not share the Babu's surprise that he refused the
acorns proffered to him, but it did seem odd that when the Babu
callously shook his stick at the old man and said "<i>Huh!</i>" he swarmed
with great agility up the tree and made faces.</p>

<p>It was only when the limpness of his tail was mentioned that I suddenly
realised we were talking about a sick monkey.</p>

<p>Letters from the Battalion, 7000 feet below, drift up to me
occasionally, but they contain little beyond the old sentiment,
expressed hundreds of times daily by Territorials from the Himalayas to
the Nilghiris. India is a marvellous and unique country; to have lived
in it is an education and a joy; to have guarded it a proud Imperial
privilege. But most of us would give something to get out of it and into
Europe. Yours ever,</p>

<h2>LIEUTENANT ALEC JOHNSTON.</h2>

<p>A brother-officer attached to the King's Shropshire Light Infantry
writes from the Front:&mdash;"I thought you would like to hear some details
of the death in action of Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Alec Johnston</span>, who used to write
'At the Front' in <i>Punch</i>. I knew him well and we were rather especial
friends.</p>

<p>"On the night of the 21st of April the Battalion, which was resting at
the time, was suddenly ordered to attack some six hundred yards of
trenches which the enemy had taken two nights previously. <span class="smcap">Johnston's</span>
Company was in the centre, and, after the O.C. had been severely wounded
just before we attacked, <span class="smcap">Johnston</span> led the Company and captured the
position most gallantly with the bayonet. He then went on himself and
personally reconnoitred the ground up to the German line. He found them
massing for a counter-attack and came back and gave warning. When the
enemy attacked they were driven off with heavy loss. He was
indefatigable all night consolidating the recaptured position, exposing
himself on top all the time in order to move about more quickly.</p>

<p>"At dawn, he sent the only other officer then remaining unwounded to the
safest part of the trench, saying that when it got too light to stay on
top he himself would get into 'the first old crump hole.' He stayed up
too long, and was shot through the heart by a German sniper.</p>

<p>"He was a general favourite and loved by his men. He had done more
dangerous patrol work than any two other officers in the battalion, and
the hotter the situation the cooler he got.</p>

<p>"The way he used to write his articles was very characteristic of the
man. I have seen him lying flat on his face in a tiny dug-out no bigger
or higher than the underneath of a small dinner-table, in the front line
trench, dashing off the first half of one of his quaint articles to
<i>Punch</i>. He would have to stop in the middle and crawl out on patrol up
to the German wire, have a scrap out there with a Bosch patrol at a few
yards' range, stay out for two or three hours, and crawl back, soaked to
the skin and covered with mud, to finish his article in time for the
post.</p>

<p>"His name had already gone in for distinction, and if he had lived he
certainly would have had a decoration conferred for his work in this
last show.</p>

<p>"As you probably know, his articles were awfully appreciated by every
one out here, and in his quaintly witty way he caught perfectly the
spirit 'at the Front.'"</p>

reading without any such frivolous aids.</p>

<p>There was little opposition. Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick Banbury</span> once more appeared in
his favourite character of the conscientious objector. He was not on
this occasion "the champion of the suffering rich," as Mr. <span class="smcap">Duke</span> called
him the other day, but the defender of the humble milkman, who already
had to rise before dawn for the greater part of the year, and might, I
gathered, be subject to unworthy suspicions if he performed his
functions before the dew was off the grass. Lord <span class="smcap">Hugh Cecil</span>, who thought
the proposal to put on the clock smacked of "the tricks of the lowest
class of journalism," is understood to have been referring to those
remarkable examples of advanced literature, the "<i>6.30 News</i>" and "<i>7.0
Star</i>."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Infant Samuel</span>, as my esteemed predecessor used to call him,
disclaimed the idea that he had become "a presumptuous <span class="smcap">Joshua</span>." The
Government only supported the proposal because it would help us during
the War by saving coal.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Henry Dalziel</span> is the proprietor of a newspaper, one of whose most
piquant features is a column entitled "Secret History of To-day," in
which one may read dark hints of Society scandals and political
intrigues. Naturally enough he objects to the new regulation forbidding
reference to the proceedings of the Cabinet. He had effective backing on
this occasion from Mr. <span class="smcap">Walter Roch</span>, who in a speech admirable alike in
tone and substance appealed to the Government in their own interests to
withdraw a ukase, under which, if strictly applied, Ministers themselves
would be the first to suffer. The Government lived too much in a balloon
(have they not just appointed a quartette of lawyers to overhaul the
Royal Flying Corps?), and would be the better for anything that brought
them into closer touch with their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>After an excited protest by Mr. <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span> against the executions in
Ireland it was not, perhaps, a fortunate moment for Sir <span class="smcap">John Lonsdale</span> to
suggest that the Military Service Bill should be extended to Ireland.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> was sympathetic in principle to the idea, but made it plain
that in practice it was impossible, since Mr. <span class="smcap">Redmond</span> was opposed to it.
Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Carson</span> thought the fact deplorable while recognising its
cogency; but he suggested that if the Nationalist leader was the
indirect Governor of Ireland he should be given the responsibility
instead of exercising it second-hand. Mr. <span class="smcap">Redmond</span> promptly denied that he
had either power or responsibility; otherwise the recent occurrences in
Ireland would, he alleged, not have happened. Mr. <span class="smcap">Churchill</span>, now home
from the Front on unlimited leave, drew from these two speeches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
inference that the future of Ireland depended upon their authors sinking
their differences and acting together, and expressed the sanguine view
that the Irish Question was nearing a settlement. Members, recalling
similarly sanguine prophecies from the same source about Gallipoli and
the German Navy, were not so much impressed as they were meant to be.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, May 10th.</i>&mdash;Among the Distinguished Strangers in the Gallery
was a deputation from the Russian Duma, led by its Vice-President.
Unfortunately M. <span class="smcap">Protopopoff</span> and his colleagues did not see our
Parliament at its best. In the Commons the Nationalist factions were
noisily assailing the <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span> with protests against the
executions of the rebel leaders, and ultimately succeeded in inducing
him to give them a day for what must in the circumstances be a premature
discussion.</p>

<p>Then our Russian friends went to the Lords, where they found a
discussion on Ireland actually in progress. It was started by Lord
<span class="smcap">Loreburn</span>, who accused the Government of having neglected the elementary
duty of protecting the law-abiding population, and urged upon them
collectively the necessity of being as candid as Mr. <span class="smcap">Birrell</span> had been
individually. The War had furnished many instances of the danger to
national interests of silence carried to excess. Then Lord <span class="smcap">Midleton</span>
rehearsed a grim catalogue of cases in which the Irish police had been
instructed to shut their eyes to seditious offences.</p>

<p>Happily the Russian visitors had left before Lord <span class="smcap">Crewe</span> rose to make the
Government's defence, for I am afraid that they would not have carried
away a high impression of Ministerial eloquence or Ministerial
statesmanship.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, May 11th.</i>&mdash;To Mr. <span class="smcap">Redmond's</span> obvious annoyance Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillon</span>
developed a savage attack on the military authorities. They, one
gathered, were brutal murderers; the Sinn Feiners, on the contrary, were
gallant if misguided patriots of whom he was proud. The <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span>,
mildly observing that Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillon</span> had forgotten some of the elementary
rules of justice, brought the debate back to the level of common sense
by contrasting the small number of executions with the heavy toll of
military and civilian life that the rebels had taken. Repeating his
<i>coup</i> of two years ago, when he went to the War Office after the
Curragh incident, he now announced his immediate intention to go to
Ireland, in the hope of discovering some arrangement for the future
which would commend itself to all parties. Some of the difficulties that
Mr. <span class="smcap">Asquith</span> will encounter in his laudable enterprise were indicated by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Healy</span>, who hoped that he would put an end to Dublin Castle and the
jobbery that had been carried on there by Mr. <span class="smcap">Redmond</span> and his friends.</p>

<p>In the Lords the Government's Irish policy was again assailed from all
sides; but more damaging even than the attacks was Lord <span class="smcap">Lansdowne's</span>
defence. He actually blamed Lord <span class="smcap">Midleton</span> for having contented himself
with warning the <span class="smcap">Chief Secretary</span> and the <span class="smcap">Prime Minister</span> of the dangerous
happenings in Ireland, and not having come to him (Lord <span class="smcap">Lansdowne</span>), or
to Mr. <span class="smcap">Balfour</span>, or to Mr. <span class="smcap">Long</span>. This new doctrine of collective
irresponsibility seems fairly to justify the definition, "A Coalition is
something that does not coalesce."</p>

<h2>PETHERTON'S PARROT.</h2>

<p>Matters are getting worse between Petherton and myself; in fact if any
friendship had ever existed between us I am afraid one would say that we
are now in a state of complete estrangement, resulting from the invasion
of my premises by his parrot, and the ensuing correspondence. My opening
gambit was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Petherton</span>,&mdash;My immediate object in addressing you is to ask
whether by any chance you have lost a parrot, because a bird of that
species flew through an open bedroom window of my house this morning
without invitation or encouragement from us.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the bird is yours, but have nothing but what
I might term the synthetic process of reasoning for arriving at this
conclusion. If you have lost anything of a parroty nature, and will
write me a description of it, I will see whether it tallies with the
bird in whose possession we are. I describe the situation in this way
because it more truly expresses it than the converse would do.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yours faithfully,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">H. J. Fordyce</span>.</span></p>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>Petherton countered with the following:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In reply to your absurdly worded letter I have lost a parrot, a
grey one. I do not know why you should have inferred that the bird at
your place belongs to me, unless you had already heard that mine is
missing, in which case I should have thought the proper course would
have been to return it.</p>

<p>I suppose, however, that to a person of your nature such a simple
procedure would have been impossible. The writing of unnecessary, stupid
and rather annoying letters seems to be an obsession with you.</p>

<p>I shall be obliged by your giving the bird to the bearer of this note.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yours truly,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Frederick Petherton</span>.</span></p>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>The yeast of controversy was evidently beginning to work, and I kept it
going with:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Petherton</span>,&mdash;What a noble literary effort is yours, but, if I may be
allowed to criticise it, it seems to me that while your technique is
almost faultless there is lack of a sense of values in the composition.
Word-painting is a delightful art, but surely in this case the most
important feature should have been a telling description of your missing
bird. The mere outward hue of the parrot is not sufficient; I wanted you
to describe its habits, accomplishments and the colour of its language;
and in face of your meagre description I should not feel justified in
handing over this bird to you, in spite of its being a grey one.</p>

<p>Mind you, I believe you belong to this parrot, but I should like further
proof. I have made no other inquiries in Surbury, but possibly someone
else in the neighbourhood may have a grey parrot on the loose.</p>

<p>Trusting to have a satisfactory reply at your leisure,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">I am,</span> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yours faithfully,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 8em;"><span class="smcap">H. J. Fordyce</span>.</span></p>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p>Petherton by this time was up on his hind legs. He wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>Confound you, Sir! The bird is undoubtedly mine. It is grey, talks a
little, and puts its head on one side after the manner of its kind. I
need not give you a fuller description of it; you know perfectly well
the bird is mine, and if you do not return it at once I shall take
legal steps for the recovery of my property.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Frederick Petherton.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Fred</span>,&mdash;I am sorry you should be so upset by the loss of a bird that
must have been a cause of considerable embarrassment to you at times,
that is if the bird which at present conducts our <i>ménage</i> is yours.</p>

<p>If you would only provide me with a list of the phrases most favoured by
your parrot I should be able to come to a definite conclusion on the
point of ownership. In a general way the bird here tallies with your
description.</p>

<p>As you practically ask for their name, my solicitors are Messrs. Smith,
Smith, Smith &amp; Jones, which may be algebraically expressed (though not
on the envelope) as 3 (<i>Smith</i>) + <i>Jones</i>.</p>

<p>In the event of your going on the war-path these gentlemen would accept
service of any billets-doux on my behalf.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yours,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Harry J. Fordyce</span>.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;If you have any sort of book explaining how to subp&oelig;na a
parrot, do lend it me like a good chap. If I find it necessary to call
it (the parrot), its evidence will have to be heard <i>in camerâ</i>, I
fancy.</p>

<hr class="hr3" />
<p>This elicited from Petherton:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;As my parrot has now been in your possession for several days it
is more than possible that it has acquired a taste for strong language.
It certainly was a model of propriety before it strayed on to your
premises.</p>

<p>Unless the bird is back in my possession before the 29th inst. I shall
instruct my solicitors to serve a writ upon yours, without further
warning or intimation of any kind, as I consider your behaviour most
unwarrantable, though characteristic.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fflly. yours,</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Fredk. Petherton</span>.</span></p>

<p>I sent the bird back the next morning, the 28th, with a note:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Freddy</span>,&mdash;The bird itself has at last provided me with the proof
which you were unable or unwilling to supply. Among a string of other
rather fruity remarks which it made while we were at breakfast this
morning it indulged&mdash;vicariously, one assumes&mdash;in a hope as to my future
which has removed any traces of doubt lingering in my mind as to the
bird's ownership.</p>

<p>My wife and maid-servant were present, and as the remark was a very
comprehensive one and indicated me by name I am not sure that an action
for libel would not lie against you.</p>

<p>But I am not vindictive, so return the bird to a more fitting <i>milieu</i>.</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yours,</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Harry</span>.</span></p>

<p>I am still waiting for Petherton's letter of thanks.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<h4>"<span class="smcap">Hamlet.</span>"</h4>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin Harvey</span> has evidently approached this high matter of the
<span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span> Tercentenary celebration with the sincerity and
thoughtfulness which have so often laid us under debt to him. He makes
you feel that his heart is more with his "darling" author than with any
other lesser man. It is only an implacable public that has attached him
so persistently to the steps of a guillotine against a blood-red sky.</p>

<p>It shows a considerable virtue in him to have adopted, without straining
after a perversely original and disquieting effect, the very sensible
simplifications of our modernist school. To play substantially the whole
of <i>Hamlet</i> in under three and a-half hours is a highly creditable feat
of stage direction. But the curtain method does more than give speed.
Its rich simplicity provides an excellent foil for the jewel of this
wonderful stage play. Of course it has its disadvantages. It tends to
muffle the voice. On the other hand it lets through a certain amount of
unrehearsed effect. I noted, for instance, even as <i>Polonius</i> was being
pinked behind the arras, the voice of a stage carpenter complaining to
his mate.</p>

<p>It showed wisdom, too, to confine the curtains to the interiors. The
built-up crenellations of the battlement scenes, with the series of
broad steps in front of them, was admirable for grouping and for
movement, though it may be doubted whether the parapet would have
provided adequate cover against the slings and arrows of a tough enemy;
or even if it would have sufficed to prevent the Danes, when under the
influence of wassail, from toppling into the moat. In the play scene the
setting of the "Mouse Trap" against the "fourth wall," whereby the
audience had a fuller view of the principals, entirely justified itself.
The lighting was effective without being fussy.</p>

<p>The costumes call for little comment, which is as it should be. I fell
to wondering in the last Act about what I took to be a team of local
base-ball players&mdash;the four stout fellows with the black raven on their
sweaters. And most distinctly would I counsel Mr. <span class="smcap">Harvey</span>, at his
entrance in the graveyard scene, to show a leg. In the murky gloom, with
his inky cloak and proudly feathered bonnet, he was dangerously near
giving the impression of a very smart young widow walking out with
<i>Horatio</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harvey</span> seemed at his very best in the earlier phases of the play.
The reflective passages were excellent; the homelier bouts of dialogue
were easy and varied; and his fine voice often enriched the splendid
text. As the plot thickened and the eternally unsolvable in the reading
and rendering of <i>Hamlet's</i> malady became more pressing, he seemed a
little to lose grip. As, certainly, he lost the essential pace&mdash;the
death scene unquestionably limped. His slurs, his impetuous
<i>accelerandos</i>, his rather violent <i>sforzandos</i>, perhaps challenge
criticism. But let us acknowledge them to be trifles. Mr. <span class="smcap">Harvey</span> filled
three short hours with the glory of a great name, and that should be
reward enough for him.</p>

<p>I see no reason to protest against Mr. <span class="smcap">Rutland Barrington's</span> unusually
whimsical <i>Polonius</i>. True it did not fit that noblest of purple
passages, the homily to <i>Laertes</i>. But then neither does the <i>Polonius</i>
of the rest of the text&mdash;our <span class="smcap">Will</span> is like that. Mr. <span class="smcap">Ross's</span> notable bass
and admirable elocution lent mystery and majesty to the <i>Ghost</i>. A full
audience applauded long and heartily at the curtain's fall. No one would
be less inclined than Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin Harvey</span> to keep back grudgingly any
share of that applause which was meant as a tribute to the memory of the
exalted dead.<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><b>T.</b></span></p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">H. A. Vachell</span> is to be congratulated upon having evolved in <i>The
Triumph of Tim</i> (<span class="smcap">Smith</span>, <span class="smcap">Elder</span>) one idea that is as ingenious as it is
novel. <i>Tim</i>, who had no legal right to any particular name, started
life as a blameless schoolboy under the designation of <i>Tim White</i>.
Subsequent events having necessitated his retirement to the New World,
he began again there as <i>Tim Green</i>, and so on, through a period of
prosperity as <i>Brown</i>, one of adversity as <i>Black</i>, into the tranquil
conclusion of <i>Grey</i>. Of course this did make it a little confusing for
the other characters, one of whom (not without justice) called him
"parti-coloured." Also, while providing a pleasant variety of interest,
it goes rather against one's chance of forming any definite idea of
<i>Tim</i> as a coherent being. But, despite this, Mr. <span class="smcap">Vachell's</span> longest
novel is in many ways his best yet. There are obviously personal touches
in his pictures of Californian life; and he seems equally at home in
dealing with every phase of his hero's chameleon career. The other
characters also are well drawn, notably <i>Ivy</i>, the unrepentant little
wanton through whom came <i>Tim's</i> first lapse in the colour scale. And
the end, which restores him to England, home and unexpected fatherhood
(unexpected, that is, to those whom familiarity with Mr. <span class="smcap">Vachell's</span>
methods had not kept on the watch for precisely this development), is
both sincere and moving.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>In choosing <i>The Road to Nowhere</i> (<span class="smcap">Allen and Unwin</span>) as the title to his
novel, Mr. <span class="smcap">Eric Leadbitter</span> sounds, at any rate, a note of warning to
those who like their heroes to repose in the last chapter upon a bed of
roses. <i>Joe</i>, of Camberwell and very humble origin, has social ambitions
and some natural aptitude for fulfilling them. He is an intriguing
study, though I cannot believe in him as firmly as I can in his vulgar
relations. That he may arrive at the point where the snares of wealth
are to encompass him round about he is allowed to win a prize in the
Calcutta Sweep, and then to have a successful flutter in options. In
this way he wins his complete emancipation from Camberwell. The process
is so absurdly easy that one imagines Mr. <span class="smcap">Leadbitter</span> to have said to
himself, "Money is not worth much, any way, so it doesn't matter how
<i>Joe</i> gets it." As far as filthy lucre is concerned one can only commend
this attitude, but unfortunately the reader may suspect that he also is
the object of a certain measure of contempt on the part of the author.
This suspicion, however, is not going to deter me from expressing my
approval of the work of a writer who is more concerned with his main
idea than with the method by which he gets to it. In the end I was left
with a real admiration for his courage and ability.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p><i>Riches and Honour</i> (<span class="smcap">Smith</span>, <span class="smcap">Elder</span>) tells of the kind of thing our
Empire-builders had to face on the Gold Coast of a quarter-century ago.
It is good for us to learn these things, and Mr. <span class="smcap">W. H. Adams</span>' rather dry
catalogue method of filling in the local colour seems to vouch for
honest knowledge. The story, not in the least dry, is packed with
adventure, rebel chiefs, fetishes and fevers, and a dash of love. It is
<i>Captain Tarleton</i>, of H.M. Gold Coast Constabulary, whose riches and
honour are in question. Eagerly expecting the death of a rotten brother
and the pouching of a fat inheritance, he so allows this to prey on his
mind that, when the great chance comes of an important cutting-out
expedition of the kind for which he, keenest and most resourceful of
soldiers and adored leader of his fearless Hausas, is widely famous, his
nerve just goes to little bits. I suppose there are men who think it so
desperately important to succeed to money they haven't earned that they
go off their feed and throw aside habits of courage long fortified by
rigorous self-discipline; but I must say it doesn't seem very
convincing. But then the author may have met poor <i>Tarleton</i> in the
flesh.</p>

</div>

<hr class="hr3" />

<p><i>Josiah</i>, head of the family whose name, <i>Chapel</i>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Miles Lewis</span> has
given to his South Wales story (<span class="smcap">Heinemann</span>), realised quite suddenly in
middle life that if he was ever to restore the fortunes of his house,
then unhappily depressed, he must wake up and stir about a bit; must in
fact seize fate and the world by the throat and demand his own. In this
laudable intention he is entitled, I suppose, to one's sympathies,
though it hardly seems necessary for him to have adopted the manners of
a bear along with its strength; but when in the course of his wrestlings
with destiny he descended to paltry sharp-practice over a business
bargain, and <i>Griff</i>, his son, followed suit, one began to wonder
whether, after all, the County would benefit much by the restoration of
the old stock. Yet there was something likeable about <i>Griff</i> that made
one at any rate half glad to see him back in the ancestral seat; but
even then the marriage that put him there had a little too much the air
of good strategy, though the author, it would seem, has no uneasiness in
regard to these little meannesses of his heroes. This, however, may be a
matter of taste; but there is less excuse for the way I in which he has
cut his book up into two parallel stories which really have very little
to connect them. He does tie them together after a fashion when he
effects a reconciliation between father and son in the last chapter; but
seeing that this is so long delayed, and results in a rather horrible
anti-climax, there is not much gained. In spite of all these grumbles
you are not to infer that there is nothing to appreciate in this book;
there is much that is good, the minor characters being about the best of
it.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
